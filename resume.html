<h1>Education</h1>

<p><em>Candidate for Bachelor of Computer Science, 
    <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a></em>
</p>
<p>
I am pursuing a co-op degree in CS, and on track to graduate in June, 2019. In
my four terms at Waterloo, I have learned many important concepts including:
</p>
<ul><li>Basic algorithms</li>
    <li>Stacks, queues, BSTs, and other common data structures</li>
    <li>Fundamentals of object-oriented software development</li>
    <li>Logical analysis of programs</li>
    </ul>
This term, I am enrolled in three more CS courses, including "Foundations of
Sequential Programs", in which we get to write compilers. I am very excited.

<h1>Work Experience</h1>
I have completed my first Co-op term at Waterloo, and am currently looking
for employment for my second, for the months of May-August, 2016. 
<h3>Testing Analyst at <a href="http://www.pointclickcare.com">PointClickCare </a></h3>
<p> As a Testing Analyst at PointClickCare, I learned many valuable skills,
including programming in Visual Basic, troubleshooting client problems, 
and root-cause analysis of software bugs. My daily tasks included: monitoring
hourly error reports, resolving support cases, communicating with clients, 
and writing scripts and macros to automate other processes. Most of these
were written either in <b>Visual Basic</b> or <b>Bash</b>. The app itself was written
entirely in <b>Java</b>, so I also spent a portion of my term learning to debug
Java code.
</p>
<h3>Technical Assistant at <a href="http://catt.ca">The Centre for Advancement of Trenchless Technologies</a></h3>
During my study terms at Waterloo I have been working part-time at CATT, an 
on-campus civil engineering research centre. As Technical Assistant, I was 
responsible for maintaining and developing their three <b>Wordpress</b> websites:
<code><a href="http://catt.ca">catt.ca</a></code>, 
<code><a href="http://canadiantrenchlessdirectory.ca">canadiantrenchlessdirectory.ca</a></code>
and, <code><a href="http://roadshow2015.cattevents.ca">roadshow2015.cattevents.ca</a></code>.
I was also responsible for resolving daily technical issues, and maintaining
the three Windows machines used in the office. The biggest challenge I faced
working at CATT was the state of their websites. They had all gone through
the hands of multiple developers and were messy at best. I really learned the
value of being able to read and understand code written by someone else.
<h1>Volunteer Experience</h1>
My involvement in extracurriculars at university has really contributed to 
my personal growth as well as my development of professional skills. I've 
been involved with various levels of my University's student government,
and have been doing committee work for the Women in Computer Science 
Undergraduate Committee for the past year.
<h3>Women in CS Undergraduate Committee <a href="http://wics.uwaterloo.ca">(WiCS)</a></h3>
The WiCS Undergraduate Committee is an on-campus group committed to creating
a welcoming environment for women and other marginalized groups in STEM. I 
have served as Chair and External Liaison for the committee. In both these 
roles it was my responsibility to represent the committee publicly, and
maintain our relations with external groups. Through this I developed my
<b>public speaking</b> and <b>communication skills</b> greatly. It was also my responsibility
to manage the other members of the committee, and through this I grew as 
a team leader.

<p>In my time at WiCS I also worked for our systems-committee. In this role
I learned about <b>Linux systems administration</b>. I also worked on our committee's
website, and learned to use <b>Git</b> and Github. See more details about this on
my <a href="http://fboxwala.github.io/projects">projects</a> page.</p>

<h3>The Mathematics Society <a href="http://mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca">(MathSoc)</a></h3>
MathSoc is the Faculty of Mathematic's student government. I have served as
a CS representative on MathSoc Council, representing the interests of
CS students at bi-weekly council meetings. In this role, I developed skills
such as <b>policy writing</b>, <b>problem solving</b> and, <b>conflict 
resolution.</b>

<h3>The Federation of Students <a href="http://feds.ca">(Feds)</a></h3>
Feds is Waterloo's university-wide student government. I am currently
serving a term as a Feds Math Councillor, representing the interests of 
Math students at monthly council meetings. During these meetings I learned
to effectively and concisely <b>communicate</b> an argument.
