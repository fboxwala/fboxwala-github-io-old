<h3>“Can I Pass?” Android Application</h3>
I wrote a tiny application in Android Studio to help students calculate their
marks. The app tells you what mark you need to get your desired mark in a 
course.
I have not had a lot of time to work on it recently, but I would like to expand
the app to track your marks throughout the term, and tell you whether you are 
on track to get your desired mark.
You can download the apk of my app [here](canipass.apk)!

<h3>WiCS UW Website</h3>
As part of my work on the Women in CS committee at UWaterloo, I help to 
develop our official website [`wics.uwaterloo.ca`](http://wics.uwaterloo.ca).
Our code is available publicly in our [Github repo](http://githib.com/wicsuw/website). 
Working on this website has taught me how to contribute to an open-source project,
as well as how to use Git and Markdown.

<h3>Other Open-Source Technology</h3>
Recently I have been trying to contribute to open-source technolgies. You can
see my contributions on my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/fboxwala)!

<h3>This Website!</h3>
My personal website is developed mostly in Markdown and Sass, and is powered
using Jekyll. You can view all the source code for my site in my [public repo](http://github.com/fboxwala/fboxwala/github.io).
