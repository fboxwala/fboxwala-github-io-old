Education
=======
_Candidate for Bachelor of Computer Science, University of Waterloo_

I am pursuing a co-op degree in CS, and on track to graduate in June, 2019. In
my four terms at Waterloo, I have learned many important concepts including:
- Basic algorithms
- Stacks, queues, BSTs, and other common data structures
- Fundamentals of object-oriented software development
- Logical analysis of programs

This term, I am enrolled in three more CS courses, including "Foundations of
Sequential Programs", in which we get to write compilers. I am very excited.
